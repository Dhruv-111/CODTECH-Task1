# Overview of This Project

### Projetct: PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER

### Objective

The primary objective of this code is to evaluate the strength of a user-provided password. The code aims to ensure that the password adheres to best practices for security by analyzing three key aspects: length, complexity, and uniqueness. Each aspect contributes to an overall score that determines the password's strength. The program also provides detailed feedback to guide the user in creating a more secure password if necessary.
