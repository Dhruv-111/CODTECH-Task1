# Overview of This Project

### Projetct: PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER

### Objective

The primary objective of this code is to evaluate the strength of a user-provided password. The code aims to ensure that the password adheres to best practices for security by analyzing three key aspects: length, complexity, and uniqueness. Each aspect contributes to an overall score that determines the password's strength. The program also provides detailed feedback to guide the user in creating a more secure password if necessary.

### Key Activities

**Length Check:**

The password's length is assessed to ensure it meets the minimum requirement of 8 characters.
Feedback is provided on whether the length is too short, adequate, or strong.

**Complexity Check:**

The password is examined for the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
A complexity score is calculated based on the presence of these character types.
Feedback is given on how to improve complexity if some character types are missing.

**Uniqueness Check:**

The password is compared against a set of common words and patterns to ensure it is not easily guessable.
Repeated characters are also checked.
Feedback is provided on the password's uniqueness.

**Overall Strength Evaluation:**

The scores from the length, complexity, and uniqueness checks are combined to determine the total score.
The password is classified as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong" based on the total score.
Comprehensive feedback is provided to help the user understand the strengths and weaknesses of their password.
